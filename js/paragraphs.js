    "Value your time. It is all you have. It's more important than your money. It's more important than your friends. It is more important than anything. Your time is all you have. Do no waste your time. This doesn't mean you can't relax. As long as you're doing what you want, it's not a waste of your time. But if you're not spending your time doing what you want, and you're not earning, and you're not learning-what the heck are you doing? Don't spend your time making other people happy. Other people being happy is their problem. If you are happy, it makes other people happy. If you're happy, other people will ask you how you might learn from it, but you are not responsible for making other people happy.",
    "There is another type of risk that we all take that can never be recouped. It's gone forever. And the risk is time. When we invest our time in anything, it's lost forever. It never gets renewed or returned to us. Yet, because we are all given what seems to be an abundance of time, it has very little value. So, we spend an enormous amount of our time engaged in wasteful activities, such as sitting in front of a TV for hours, commenting on Facebook, watching YouTube videos, sitting at a bar, lying in bed, or engaging in some other non-productive activity. When we waste time, it's gone forever. We don't consider how precious time is until we are older and realize our time is running out. Time needs to be invested wisely-pursuing goals, dreams, or some major purpose in life.",
    "Parents, teachers, company managers, and anyone in the position of authority has the capacity to eliminate the negative, limiting beliefs and bad habits of their children, students, and employees. We all need to positively inspire everyone we are in a position to influence. One person can change the entire life of another person by simply altering their beliefs, which will, in turn, rid them of their bad daily habits forever.",
    "The secret to getting results that last is to never stop making improvements. It's remarkable what you can build if you just don't stop. It's remarkable the business you can build if you don't stop working. It's remarkable the body you can build if you don't stop training. It's remarkable the knowledge you can build if you don't stop learning. It's remarkable the fortune you can build if you don't stop saving. It's remarkable the friendships you can build if you don't stop caring. Small habits don't add up. They compound.",
    "I can guarantee that if you manage to start a habit and keep sticking to it, there will be days when you feel like quitting. When you start a business, there will be days when you don't feel like showing up. When you're at the gym, there will be sets that you don't feel like finishing. When it's time to write, there will be days that you don't feel like typing. But stepping up when it's annoying or painful or draining to do so, that's what makes the difference between a professional and an amateur.",
    "Professionals stick to the schedule; amateurs let life get in the way. Professional know what is important to them and work toward it with purpose; amateurs get pulled off course by the urgencies of life. Variable rewards or not, no habit will stay interesting forever. At some point, everyone faces the same challenge on the journey of self-improvement: you have to fall in love with boredom.",
    "Boiling water will soften a potato but harden an egg. You can't control whether you're a potato or an egg, but you can decide to play a game where its' better to be hard or soft. If you can find a more favorable environment, you can transform the situation from one where the odds are against you to one where they are in your favor.",
    "What comes naturally to me? For just a moment, ignore what you have been taught. Ignore what society has told you. Ignore what others expect of you. Look inside yourself and ask, “What feels natural to me? When have I felt alive? When have I felt like the real me?” No internal judgements or people-pleasing. No second-guessing or self-criticism. Just feelings of engagement and enjoyment. Whenever you feel authentic and genuine, you are headed in the right direction.",
    "Every habit produces multiple outcomes across time. Unfortunately, theses outcomes are often misaligned. With our bad habits, the immediate outcome usually feels good, but the ultimate outcome feels bad. With good habits, it is the reverse: the immediate outcome is unenjoyable, but the ultimate outcome feels good. The French economist Frederic Bastiat explained the problem clearly when he wrote, “It almost always happens that when the immediate consequence is favorable, the later consequences are disastrous, and vice versa… Often, the sweeter the first fruit of a habit, the more bitter are its later fruits",
    "I can go on and on. You get the point. When you allow negativity to rule your thoughts, you are programming your brain for failure. You'll have no chance in life at breaking out of your current financial or life circumstances. These negative thoughts will become beliefs that act like computer programs. Worse, if you have children, they will adopt your negative thinking and struggle in life as adults. This is why the saying “the poor get poorer” has so much truth to it.",
    "A few millionaires in my study said they figured out some people really do want to help and the asking for help was a numbers game. Some will say no, but some will say yes and offer to help. I personally struggle with this rich habit. Let me tell you how I overcame these fears recently. Success magazine was profiling me in their November 2014 edition, and it dawned on me that I might not have enough money to meet the demand for books (I was self-published). It took me three weeks to muster the courage to make my first phone call to a millionaire to help fund the book sales. For three weeks I dragged my feet. I was consumed with fear and doubts. But I knew from my research that self-made millionaires, despite their fears, ask for help. So, I did.",
    "Happiness. Am I happy?  What is causing me to be unhappy? How can I eliminate those things that are making me unhappy? Is my spouse happy? Are my kids happy? Are my employees or staff happy? How can I make myself happier? What is happiness? Will I ever be happy? What's making me so happy? That's a lot of thinking, I know. There are lot a day's in the year, however, to brainstorm, you just need to make it a daily habit. Eventually, over time, you will come up with solutions to your most pressing problems. You will gain insight into what makes you tick. Daily thinking will help you finds some meaning to your life. Making a daily habit of thinking is what self-made millionaires do. It's an important piece of the success puzzle. Understanding why they do it is less important than understanding that they do it.",
    "Introduce yourself properly in life you will be forced into situations where you will meet new people. This is an opportunity to develop valuable relationships. Some may be your next employer, future spouse, next best friend, future co-worker, investor, or future business partner. There are a few basic rules in making introductions: Smile, offer a firm handshake. Make eye contact. In one sentence, explain who you are, why you're there, and who you know at the event. Ask questions about the person you are introducing yourself to.",
    "You can't build a financial empire if you're ignorant of basic finance and economic. These disciplines are the building blocks to a financial empire, and without them the Sidewalk becomes a danger. Remember, more money doesn't solve money problems. If not educating yourself after graduation is one step on the Sidewalk, the other is not educating yourself on basic finance and economics.",
    "Successful businesses rarely evolve from some legendary idea. Nope, successful entrepreneurs take existing concepts and make them better. They take poorly met needs and solve them better. Skep the big idea and go for the big execution. You don't need an idea that has never been done before. Old ideas suffice; just take it and do it better! Execute like no one has!",
    "Education is free for your consumption. Infinite knowledge is at your fingertips and the only thing preventing you from getting it is you. Yes, YOU. Turn off the TV, pick up a book, and read it. Quit playing Guitar Hero and hit the library. Quit playing Gameboy grab-ass and hit the books. A committed Fastlaner has his nose in a book weekly. He attends seminars. He troll's business forums. He's on Google, searching different topics and strategies.",
    "Regardless of age, reflect on your life and analyze the forks in the road and where those forks have taken you. The forks are choices, both large and small, and each shares the common thread of having the magnificent power to take you somewhere different. Whatever you decide today impacts tomorrow, weeks, moths, years decades, and yes, generations. If you're younger than 30, your choices are at peak horsepower because they are growing the think branches of your choice tree. Time to put the pedal to the metal.",
    "There is one weakness in people for which there is no remedy. It is the universal weakness of Lack of ambition! People, especially those on salary, who schedule their spare time and slack time to provide for self-improvement seldom remain at the bottom very long. Their action opens the way for the upward climb, removes many obstacles from their path, and gains the friendly interest of those who have the power to put them in the way of opportunity.",
    "It is a remarkable illustration of the power of a definite desire. Barnes won his goal because he wanted to be a business associate of Mr. Edison more than he wanted anything else. He created a plan by which to attain that purpose. But he burned all bridges behind him. He stood by his desire until it became the dominating obsession of his life – and, finally a fact. When he went to orange, he did not say to himself, I will try to induce Edison to give me a job of some sort. He said, I will see Edison and put him on notice that I have come to go into business with him. He did not say, I will work there for a few moths and If I get no encouragement, I will quit and get a job somewhere else. He did say, I will start anywhere, I will do anything Edison tells me to do, but before I am though, I will be his associate.",
    "Before success comes in anyone's life, that individual is sure to meet with much temporary defeat and, perhaps, some failure. When defeat overtakes a person, the easiest and most logical thing to do is to quit. That is exactly what the majority of people do. More than 500 of the most successful individuals this country has ever known have told me that their greatest success came just one step beyond the point at which defeat had overtaken them. Failure is a trickster with a keen sense of irony and cunning. It takes great delight in tripping one when success is almost within reach.",
    "Work hard: Elon Musk is currently the acting CEO of two companies, worth over 41 billion. He is also chairman of the board of several more in addition to funding two charities and a project to change long-range travel forever. Hard work is the backbone of any type of success. As Musk once pointed out, if you work 100 hours per week while everyone else is working 40, then you will accomplish everything they can do in a year in a third of the time."
